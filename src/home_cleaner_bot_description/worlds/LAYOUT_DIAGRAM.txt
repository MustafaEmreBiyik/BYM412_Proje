ROOM COORDINATES (Center Points):
=====================================
- Living Room:  X = -2.0,  Y = 0.0    (Green Marker)
- Hallway:      X = 2.5,   Y = 0.0    (Yellow Marker)
- Bedroom 1:    X = 3.0,   Y = 3.25   (Blue Marker)
- Bedroom 2:    X = 3.0,   Y = -3.25  (Red Marker)


DOORWAY LOCATIONS:
=====================================
1. Living Room → Hallway:
   - Location: X = 1.0, Y = 0.0
   - Width: 0.9m
   - Direction: East-West passage

2. Hallway → Bedroom 1:
   - Location: X = 2.625, Y = 2.5
   - Width: 0.9m
   - Direction: North entrance

3. Hallway → Bedroom 2:
   - Location: X = 2.625, Y = -2.5
   - Width: 0.9m
   - Direction: South entrance

4. Bedroom 1 ↔ Bedroom 2 (via Hallway):
   - Location: X = 3.075, Y = 0.0
   - Width: 0.9m
   - Direction: North-South passage


ROBOT SPAWN RECOMMENDATION:
=====================================
Spawn the robot in the Living Room for easy navigation:
- Recommended Spawn: X = -2.0, Y = 0.0, Z = 0.1


NAVIGATION CONSIDERATIONS:
=====================================
- All doorways are 0.9m wide (standard door size)
- Robot width should be < 0.7m for safe passage
- Clear floor space in all rooms for coverage planning
- Wall collisions enabled for realistic SLAM mapping
- Ground plane is 20m x 20m (plenty of space)


TESTING CHECKLIST:
=====================================
☐ Robot spawns correctly in Living Room
☐ Robot can navigate through all doorways
☐ LIDAR detects all walls properly
☐ SLAM can map the entire apartment
☐ Coverage planner can access all rooms
☐ No wall penetration or collision issues
